<p>
Although I have many other hobbies and interests I am quite a vehicle nerd. I love cars and trucks and i have ever since I was little.
I love the feeling of being behind the wheel and being in control of a machine that you can call yours.
I personally own a Hummer H3 and I love the fact that I can take it places that other cars would not be able to get to.
I also love the feeling of going fast and being in total control. I also love hearing the loud engine and exhaust roar.
