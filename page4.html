Although I have many other hobbies and interests I am quite a vehicle nerd. I love cars and trucks and i have ever since I was little.
I love the feeling of being behind the wheel and being in control of a machine that you can call yours.
I personally own a Hummer H3 and I love the fact that I can take it places that other cars would not be able to get to.
I also love the feeling of going fast and being in total control. I also love hearing the loud engine and exhaust roar.

The person I look up to most is Derek Jeter. Derek Jeter was an American professional baseball player.
I like Derek Jeter because He played for one of the most hated teams in the MLB, the New York Yankees.
I look up to Derek Jeter because he played the game with such respect for the game and for those who played it.
He got lots of hate for the team he played for but he did not let that define him. Derek is now in the Hall of Fame
for being one of the most respected players to ever play the game.
