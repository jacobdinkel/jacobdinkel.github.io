<h2>About My Hobbies</h2>
<p>
I am a very outdoorsy person. I love the feeling of just being outside in the wide open.
I feel so free to do whatever i want when I am outside. I love to be in nature and breathe in the fresh air.
I am also a very athletic person and love playing sports. I play football and baseball, but baseball is my favorite.
I am also quite the sneakerhead. I own over 42 pairs of authentic shoes. I have one pair of Air Jordans that can sell
for up to $2,000.

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p>
My favorite hobby is fishing. I love fishing because it is very peaceful and it takes skill and knowledge.
You have to know where to position the boat and where the perfect spot to cast is. You have to make sure that
your line doesn't get tangled and also know what bait to use. You have to know how far out to curve your hook and what bait to use.
All of this knowledge adds up and adds to the excitement of fishing. Fishing is an addiction, it's that urge of knowing
what is on the other side of your line that keeps you casting. Fishing is also very rewarding and that is why I love it.

<p>
My favorite season in Minnesota is summer. Summer in Minnesota is something that all people need to experience.
Summertime in Minnesota is when everyone is smiling and happy. You also don't know summer in Minnesota unless you go out to a lake.
All of the amzing lakes that we have are what makes Minnesoat summer so special. So if you're ever looking for a summer vacation
I definitely recomend visiting Minnesoat and its great lakes.
